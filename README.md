# Testing the script atm so please use at your own risk it may not work all the time

### I will be updating this almost weekly or every time i add something new in
### this script installs linux as dual boot with windows so it uses 5-7 partitions if you do not have windows first this will not work
### This is my first time ever doing anything in bash so it will get better over time (i learnt bash 1 hour before making this script)
