# after testing it for a few days I have found one small bugs but it will not kill your system

## bugs
### hostname not being put into /etc/hostname 

### to fix the bug above just log into your new install and do sudo nano /etc/hostname and add the hostname you want in the file

### I will be updating this almost weekly or every time i add something new in
### this script installs linux as dual boot with windows so it uses 5-7 partitions if you do not have windows first this will not work
### This is my first time ever doing anything in bash so it will get better over time (i learnt bash 1 hour before making this script
