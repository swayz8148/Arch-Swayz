# Testing the script atm so please use at your own risk it may not work all the time

### I will be updating this almost weekly or every time i add something new in
### this script installs linux as dual boot with windows so it uses 5-7 partitions if you do not have windows first this will not work
### This is my first time ever doing anything in bash so it will get better over time (i learnt bash 1 hour before making this script)

#### I use bspWM and the dotfiles to that are here: https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles

#### I have just modified the themes a bit to my style i will not be providing them as i do not have owner ship over the themes :) have a fun time with the scripts
